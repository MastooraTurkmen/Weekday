# Weekday: Frontend Interview Assignment

In this project, I used ReactJS, CSS, and also Responsive Design which works for different screen sizes.

### Run The App Locally

```bash
npm run install && npm start
```

### For build and Deployment for create-react-app

```bash
npm run build
```

Add this to package.json for deployment

```js
"build": "CI= react-scripts build",
```

### Deployment üì•

1. How do we deploy our project to the Netlify site?
2. I use [Netlify App](https://app.netlify.com/) for deploying my projects.
3. From there select **_Deploy with Github_**.

4. Then write your project name and select it.
5. After selecting here you can see that the project **_Review configuration for Weekday_** and then select the **_Deploy Weekday_** Button.
6. Now the project is Live.

### React Select: For multi-select

```bash
npm install react-select
```

### Filters

I hardcoded the filters into **_data.js_** for the jobs listing based on:

- Min experience
- Company name
- Location
- Remote/on-site
- Tech stack
- Role
- Min base pay

###### Note

Number of Employees wasn't in the API, so I didn't filter that.
