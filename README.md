Add this to package.json for deployment

```

### Deployment 📥

1. How do we deploy our project to the Netlify site?
2. I use [Netlify App](https://app.netlify.com/) for deploying my projects.
3. From there select **_Deploy with Github_**.

### React Select: For multi-select

```bash
npm install react-select
```

### Filters

I hardcoded the filters into **_data.js_** for the jobs listing based on:

- Min experience
- Company name
- Location
- Remote/on-site
- Tech stack
- Role
- Min base pay

###### Note

Number of Employees wasn't in the API, so I didn't filter that.
